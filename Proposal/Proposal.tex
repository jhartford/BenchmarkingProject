\section{Outline}
MCMC is the standard method of sampling from distributions with high dim stuff...  used in JAGS, BUGS, Stan, etc.

SMC samplers offer the promise of better performance in .... situations, with the added difficulty of having to come up with transitions from simple to desired distribitions.

But... relatively little is know about their relative performance. Given the added cost to practitioners of coming up with transition blah blah blah, the natural question to ask is how much ``performance" can be gained by using SMC samplers.

To test this we will consider the performance of MCMC using Metro Hastings and Gibbs sampling, and SMC samplers in these popular contexts: bayesian non-parametric, directlet process, gaussian process, mixture models, and hierarchical models.

\section{Outline}
MCMC is the standard method of sampling from probability distributions with no closed form solutions. The abundance of efficient and easy to use implementations in popular software such as JAGS, BUGS, Stan, etc. have allowed for their widespread adoption. However, MCMC typically requires large numbers of samples to cover the space of  

SMC samplers offer the promise of better performance in .... situations, with the added difficulty of having to come up with transitions from simple to desired distribitions.

But... relatively little is know about their relative performance. Given the added cost to practitioners of coming up with transition blah blah blah, the natural question to ask is how much ``performance" can be gained by using SMC samplers.

To test this we will consider the performance of MCMC using Metro Hastings and Gibbs sampling, and SMC samplers in these popular contexts: bayesian non-parametric, directlet process, gaussian process, mixture models, and hierarchical models.
